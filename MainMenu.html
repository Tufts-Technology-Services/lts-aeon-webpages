		<p>Welcome to TASCR! The Tufts Archival Research Center welcomes all researchers to use the TARC Reading Room. Your personal research account allows you 
				to request materials directly through the <a href="https://dl.tufts.edu">Digital Library</a> and our finding aids via <a href="https://archives.tufts.edu">Archives@Tufts</a>, and <a href="http://go.tufts.edu/jumbosearch">JumboSearch</a>, 
				as well as schedule appointments to visit the Reading Room.
		<br />
		<br />
		Appointments help us organize your visit and prepare requests so they are ready for you when you arrive. They are not required before 11am, but we encourage you to use them to help streamline your work and ours. Please note that some TARC 
				materials are located in offsite storage, so we recommend you place your requests at least two business days in advance of your planned visit.</p>

				<h2>Requesting Copies</h2>
				<p>Under certain conditions specified in the United States copyright law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish reproductions of documents and publications. 
				One of the specified conditions is that the reproductions are not to be "used for any purpose other than private non-commercial study, scholarship, or research."
				I understand that if I make a request for, or later use, a reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," I may be liable for copyright infringement.</p>
				
				<p>I also understand that the TARC reserves the right to refuse to fulfill a copying order, if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve (1) violation of copyright law, or (2) damage to the material.</p>

				<p>You also must not use the name of TARC or Tufts University in any manner which creates any false association between you and the image, materials, TARC or Tufts University, or that incorrectly 
				implies any sponsorship or endorsement by TARC, Tufts University, or any third-party rights holder.</p>

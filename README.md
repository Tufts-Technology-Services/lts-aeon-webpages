# Aeon webpages

These webpages are for use with the Aeon application used by the Tufts Archival Research Center (TARC).
The webpages are maintained by Library Technology Services/Heather Klish.

## Deployment

All changes are made and tested in the Aeon testweb directory. Changes are then deployed to the Aeon production directory.

The webpages need the aeon.dll to render correctly so the pages must be modified in a directory on the Aeon server.
